A small clone of a Twitter user’s homepage. Emphasis was on functionality over design. Uses OAuth to establish API credentials and make calls on a user’s behalf. New tweets are updated into the list with a long-polling AJAX call. Infinite scrolling through past tweets is also implemented using Javascript.
